# Badgr-client

> Work In Progress: nothing to see for now.

A nodejs client for the [badgr-server](https://github.com/concentricsky/badgr-server) API.

## Tests
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is the test framework used for this project, and [chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/) is the assertion library.
Run all tests with `npm test`.

_Unit_ tests can be run with `npm run test:unit`.

Testing will automatically _lint_ and stop if code style does not pass.

## Code Style
This project follows most of the guidelines in the [mofo-style](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mofo-style) package.
Some of the rules have been modified because this is not a _front-end_ ES6 project.

_Linting_ will be run automatically with some other tasks (such as testing), but can be invoked by itself with `npm run lint`.
